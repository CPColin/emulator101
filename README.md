# Emulator 101

I did the [Emulator 101](http://www.emulator101.com/welcome.html) project in Ceylon a while ago.
Let's do it in Kotlin now!

## Running the CPU diagnostic

Obtain `cpudiag.bin` from its mirror [here](http://www.emulator101.com/files/cpudiag.bin) and place it in the `src/test/resources` directory.

## Running Invaders

Obtain `invaders.e` through `invaders.h` from one of many sources, place them in the `src/main/resources` directory, and run the `Main` class.

For sound effects, search for "MAME Space Invaders sound samples" and place `0.wav` through `8.wav` in `src/main/resources`.
